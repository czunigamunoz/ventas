                        The Wood Knot is an online refinished furniture store based in Concord, CA, East Bay. I personally find, inspect and refinish each piece to make sure I offer only high quality furniture. My pieces come from families’ homes, consignment stores and warehouse sales.  I select antique furniture made from solid wood with special attention to the craftsmanship.  I work hard to bring new life to these beautiful pieces and give them a modern look.  At the Wood Knot you can find quality, one of a kind furniture that will stand the test of time and make a statement in your home decoration.

                        <p>My name is Tatiana.</p>
                        <p>
                            I am originally from Colombia, but I currently live in California with my wonderful husband and my step-son (he is the cutest boy I ever saw). My first knowledge of wood working comes from my grandfather and my mother. My grandpa built furniture from scratch and I was always there watching him using all kinds of amazing tools. Every single piece was made so carefully and precisely and the machinery he used was so odd to me, but intriguing. On the other hand, my mom worked more on finishing furniture. She had a fixation for Asian decoration, so she made a collection full of black, gold and red with a shiny finish. It sold very well and we also had them all around the house. Both, my grandpa and my mom had other careers and woodworking and crafting were their side passions. Thanks to my family, I became very crafty and I gained the entrepreneurial spirit from my mom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I finished high school, I wanted to go to furniture design school, but it was not really an option in my family. I was expected to choose a career like engineering or accounting in order to make my mom happy. I always believed that people need to do what they like the most because that is what they are going to end up doing for the rest of their life, so they better feel happy with what they chose. So I studied Foreign Languages and Early Childhood Education in the US.  Kids helped to bring my crafty ideas to life
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I was in college my boyfriend at that time, now my husband, rescued an old desk that was left on the street. I took that piece and turned it into a beautiful one. I stained it in a dark walnut and finished it with a high gloss. Today, that piece is still as beautiful as it was many years ago and my son is using the desk in his room.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we moved into our new house, I started to decorate our home with old pieces of furniture that I found in consignment stores. I gave each piece a new look with different paints and stains.  I had so many good ideas and I also recreated the looks from some of my favorite furniture and DIY bloggers. Unfortunately my house wasn’t big enough to keep all the pieces so my husband encouraged me to put them out for sale. I enjoyed the process so much that I started finding unique pieces and worked on them almost every day. Today I finally created my own online store to sell my creations not just to the people around me, but to the entire USA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my collections you will find all kind of styles, it all depends of what the piece “wants me to do with it.” I enjoy using different colors and textures and like to combine the beautiful looks of vintage and modern. I like to create pieces using different techniques and styles for all types of personalities and spaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I welcome you to my online store and encourage you to come by every week to find new beauties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you for stopping by and I hope you enjoy all that I have to offer.
