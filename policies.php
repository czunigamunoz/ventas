                    <p class="paragraph">
                        We ship all over the U.S. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: Please leave me a message with your zip code before you purchase, so that I can determine the most cost effective shipping method. FOR ALL OTHER STATES: Shipping cost is already set up, you will see the amount in the shopping cart. Make sure to double check your address before completing your purchase.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Small items are typically shipped within three to five business days. Larger pieces may take up to three to four weeks to ship depending upon the shipping company and six to eight weeks to deliver. All pieces will be sent via UPS Ground, U-Ship or white glove. Shipping costs vary depending on each item. I do not ship to PO Boxes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I can arrange an appointment if you want to pick up the piece at no additional charge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Please, thoroughly inspect the piece before accepting delivery and signing for the freight. Any damages must be reported and written on the freight bill, so a claim can be filed. I am not responsible for any damaged items once delivery has been accepted. Please, let me know if you want to buy additional insurance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Customers who arrange their own 3rd party pick up are responsible for any potential damage which may occur during transit, and will also be responsible for purchasing shipping insurance (optional but recommended).

                        Since our pieces are vintage and one of a kind, we do not accept returns. All sales are final.

                        Like most website operators, The Wood Knot collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
                        and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
                        time of each visitor request. The Wood Knot's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
                        understand how The Wood Knot's visitors use its website. From time to time, The Wood Knot may release
